# 23-Methods-Get-Tester-API-JSON

Here i try to create a testing input to using the GET method, sending data over to the server, so they are going to use JavaScript to generate some input fields and be able to click on that.
And this is actually being submitted to the server. The server is responding with JSON data that's being returned back.
JSON data is output to the page.

Unpretentious style included!
